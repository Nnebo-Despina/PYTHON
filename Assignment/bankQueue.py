"""
make a system that a bank will use to queue their customers
it will take only their name and assign them an id
the first id will start from 1
as other customers come and put their name, they too will have their own id correlating to their order of arrival

do this such that i can come and ask for number 1 and the person that came first will be printed out
and so on
